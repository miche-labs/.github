# 👋 Hi there — welcome to Miche Labs

We’re a small team of friends who love building fun, useful, and sometimes slightly chaotic projects. 
Miche Labs is where we experiment, explore, and share the things we’re passionate about — from dev tools and automations to creative tech and side quests.

## 💡 What We Do

Think of this org as a playground for ideas. We work on:

- ✨ Experimental apps & prototypes  
- 🛠️ Developer utilities  
- 📱 Tiny tools that make life easier  
- 🎨 Creative coding projects

Some projects are polished. Some are half-baked. All are built with curiosity.

## 🙌 Get Involved

We love connecting with others who share our curiosity! While most of our projects are internal or early-stage, here’s how you can follow along or join in:

- ⭐ Star a repo if you find something cool
- 🐛 Spot a bug or have a suggestion? Open an issue
- 💬 Have a wild idea or want to collaborate? Drop us a message

Keep an eye out — we occasionally open up contributions on select projects.

## 📚 Resources

- Docs and notes live in each project’s README
- For general questions, open a discussion or check the issues
- No Discord (yet), but we're considering it 👀

## 🦉 Fun Facts

- Mondongo
- Motto: *Build weird, build often.*

Thanks for stopping by!
